## Analysis and Observation

1. What the project does?
   * Calculates the Bayes error, which is defined as the lowest possible prediction error that can be achieved.

2. How to use it?
   * Before, implementing a the model building process the data scientist can compare the estimated maximum estimated error limit. This would help to choose another other ML technique / algorithm and save precious time and computing resources thereby reducing the modeling development timeline.
   
3. Possible use cases where this project would be useful?
   * During the initial phase of model development and choosing an ideal algorithm which can achieve the target accuracy with the maximum error approximation

4. Strengths of the project
   * Ease of implementation, both textual and pictorial sample dataset configured for easy trails
  
5. Weakness/ areas of Improvement for the project.
   * NA
